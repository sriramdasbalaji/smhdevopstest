# SmartHotel360 - Public Web 
Welcome to the repository containing the public web site of the SmartHotel360. SmartHotel360 has multiple apps that share a common Azure backend, including a public website where hotel guests can book a room, smart conference rooms, and even include their accompanying family travelers and their pets! The site was built using ASP.NET Core 2.0. 

# Getting Started

Once downloaded you can open the `SmartHotel360.PublicWebSite.sln` file to open the solution in Visual Studio 2017 15.5 or higher. This solution contains two projects:

* The SmartHotel360.PublicWeb project: An [ASP.NET Core 2.0](www.dot.net) website which is a SPA web app developed using React+Redux and server-side rendering.
* The PetCheckerFunction project: An Azure Function used to analyze photos of pets using the Congnitive Services Vision API and Azure Cosmos DB.

## Running the web

Set `SmartHotel360.PublicWeb` as startup project, then hit F5 to start debugging. The web is configured to use the public endpoints for the backend, so you don't need to run the backend locally. 

## Configuring the web

The file `appsettings.Development.json` contains the settings of the web site. By default following options are used:

* `SettingsUrl`: Url of the configuration endpoint. By default it uses the public endpoint service. Only change if you are running your own backend services.
* `FakeAuth`: Contains data to "simulate" the login process. Data is `Name` (name of the user), `UserId` (id of the user), `PicUrl` (url of the user avatar).

> If `FakeAuth` is **not set** the PublicWeb site uses an Azure Active Directory B2C to enable the logins. Please read "[Enabling B2C logins](./doc/b2c.md)" if you want to use B2C logins.

If you want to deploy this application to your own Azure subscription, see [this setup guide](./doc/demo-setup.md) for instructions. 

# Demo Scripts
There is a detailed step-by-step demo script in the [demoscripts](./demoscripts/) folder of this repo that you can use in your own presentations. In order to perform the demos, you will need to deploy the application resources to Azure first. See [this setup guide](./doc/demo-setup.md) on how to do that.
